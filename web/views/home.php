      <h1>Code Otter</h1>
      <p>Welcome to Code Otter. This website is a portfolio of my school coding projects.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Otters are playful and are able to use the things they find around them to achieve their goals (like using a rock to break a mussel shell.
        My coding is similar. It is about having fun while searching around me to find the best tools to achieve my goals.

      <h3>Why Code Otter?</h3>
      <p>I'm calling this site Code Otter because I wanted to do something a little different than just portfolio site. I like coding and otters, so I combined the two.</p>
